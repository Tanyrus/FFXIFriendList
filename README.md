## Data Privacy & Terms of Service

**IMPORTANT**: This addon requires a remote server to function. By using it, you agree to the following terms. This addon is community-developed and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Square Enix or any private server operators. The service processes only in-game character data required to provide friend list functionality, including character name and realm, friend relationships and requests, presence and heartbeat timestamps used to compute online status and last seen, character metadata such as job, nation, rank, and zone when sharing is enabled, account associations, and server-synced preferences. Friend notes are stored locally and never transmitted to the server. No real-world personal information such as name, email, or address is collected. Data is used only to operate the service, is not sold, tracked, advertised, or shared with third parties, raw IP addresses are not stored by the application though infrastructure providers may process them, server-side data may be backed up for reliability, and data is retained while your account remains active with account deletion available upon request. The service is provided "as-is" with no uptime guarantees, access may be revoked for abuse or operational reasons, you are responsible for protecting your API key, and use of the addon and service is at your own risk. Continued use constitutes acceptance of these terms, which may change over time.
